`Kino` is the library used by [Livebook](https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook)
to render rich and interactive output directly from your Elixir code.

[See the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/kino).

## Installation

To bring Kino to Livebook all you need to do is `Mix.install/2`:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.3.0"}
])
```

You may need other dependencies for specific widgets, like
[`:vega_lite`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/vega_lite) for dynamic plots.
